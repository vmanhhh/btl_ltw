## Introduction

A Company Website is a modern solution that offers numerous advantages. It not only enhances brand promotion and boosts sales but also serves as an effective management tool for businesses.

At its core, a company website is a collection of web pages containing text, images, videos, and other content related to the business. These pages are accessible through a domain name on the global Internet (World Wide Web). The website provides detailed information about the company, including its history, products, services, and promotional programs.

From different perspectives, a company website can be defined as:

- **From a marketing perspective:** The website is an essential tool for delivering comprehensive information, helping customers and partners better understand the quality and value of products and services.
- **From a management perspective:** The website integrates management tools, optimizing workflow, increasing efficiency, and providing opportunities for business expansion.

## Essential Features of a Company Website

A well-designed website is the first thing that captures customers’ attention. A professional and visually appealing website reflects a company’s commitment to building a strong brand image and long-term strategic vision.

Content is a crucial element. Even if the website’s primary purpose is information delivery, its content plays a key role. Customers often search for information using keywords on search engines, and engaging content helps them discover and remember a business.

Lastly, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is essential. Studies show that 80% of users only check the top search results. A well-optimized website increases visibility and enhances customer reach.
